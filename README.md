## Background
[...]
To celebrate his years of stardom in international play, DinoFun World declared “Scott Jones Weekend”, where Scott was scheduled to appear in two stage shows each on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday to talk about his life and career.

However, the event did not go as planned. Scott’s weekend was marred by crime and mayhem perpetrated by a poor, misguided and disgruntled figure from Scott’s past.

Park officials and law enforcement figures are interested in understanding how people move and communicate in the park, as well as how patterns changes and evolve over time, and what can be understood about motivations for changing patterns.

## Mini Challenge 2

Mini-Challenge 2 asks you to dive into the communications over time that took place among the park visitors using the park app. Linkages between visitors and among park patrons and park staff could reveal behaviors of interest.

1. Identify those IDs that stand out for their large volumes of communication. For each of these IDs:
   * Characterize the communication patterns you see.
   * Based on these patterns, what do you hypothesize about these IDs?

2. Describe up to 10 communications patterns in the data. Characterize who is communicating, with whom, when and where. If you have more than 10 patterns to report, please prioritize those patterns that are most likely to relate to the crime.

3. From this data, can you hypothesize when the vandalism was discovered? Describe your rationale. 
Please limit your response to no more than 3 images and 300 words.
